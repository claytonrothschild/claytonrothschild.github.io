Welcome! This blog is a work in progress.

I am very interested in the creative destruction and disruptive effect technology has on everyday life. My favorite topics are those that are perhaps undergoing the most disruption: accessibility, economics, consumer behavior, and regulation. I hope to blog my own original insights into these territories, and the intersection of technology with each of them. The primary posts will be broad-based essays, but I intend to also post intricacies I discover for the specific technologies I am actively working with as a Consultant: currently these include Azure, React, Angular, .NET, C#, and Swift.

I am passionate about product development. Check out my side-project: [CloudPano](https://www.cloudpano.com), which has 3000+ users across the globe and has been seen on Redfin and Zillow.

I am an early adopter of the Ethereum blockchain, [creating a Proof of Concept democratic voting app and presenting on the disruptive nature of blockchains](https://github.com/claytonrothschild/BeyondBitcoin) back in 2015.

I am on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/claytonrothschild).

Please stay tuned as I fill in the gaps of this blog and write a more thorough “About me.” In the meantime, I encourage you to take a look at my [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ClayRothschild), where you will see the topics I am most interested in and the thought leaders I look up to (and constantly retweet) in the technology space.
